# DinoGame
# Pre-requisites
This project needs a p5 live server from the Atom text editor. This can be made using atom-live-server package found in Atom.

Once the live server is made, Ctrl + Shift + P and then type 'Atom Live Server: Start 3000' or press Ctrl + Alt + 3. This will launch the server in a browser.

A microphone is required to play the game.

# Game start
At the beginning, we need to wait to connect to Google's server to access the teachablemachine API.
Once, the API is loaded, then we need to say 'Go' to start the game.
We need to avoid the cactus by making the dinosaur jump. To do this, say 'Up' or press Spacebar.

# Game Over
If we crash into a cactus, the score stops increasing and the dinosaur stops, say 'Go' to restart the game.
